# Logical Operators
AND - && , OR - || , NOT - !

For AND(&&)

If both the inputs are high the output is also high(TRUE), if one of the input is unknown then the output is also unknown, if one of the input is low so it fails.

For OR(||)

If one of the input is high then the output is high else low.

For NOT(!)

It is opposite to above operations.
